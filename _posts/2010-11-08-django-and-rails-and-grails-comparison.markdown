I've recently found a link to an interesting presentation at [zenzire.com](http://www.zenzire.com/archive/comparison-between-django-rails-and-grails/). Its author, [Jaime Buelta](http://wrongsideofmemphis.wordpress.com/), speaks about differences between Django, Rails and Grails frameworks.





I know Django and Grails. Personally, I like both of them. I can't only disagree with one argument about Grails - it's rather poorly documented. But still, it deserves to give it a shot.





Just take a look at it.
