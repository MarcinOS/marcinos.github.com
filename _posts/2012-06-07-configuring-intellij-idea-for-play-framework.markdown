Some time ago I recorded a short screencast describing how to configure Play! Framework 1.2.4 with IntelliJ IDEA 11. The point was to promote the framework and to get some experience in screencasts recording :)

I'm aware it's a bit outdated now, since Play! 2 has been released. However, I decided to publish it. I hope somebody make a use of it!
