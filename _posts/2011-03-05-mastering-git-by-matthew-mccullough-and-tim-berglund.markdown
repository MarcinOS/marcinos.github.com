On the beginning, I just want to say one thing - McCullough and Berglund on Mastering Git is a perfect way to learn Git! The only requirement is an ability to learn in a classroom-type environment. An impression of class or conference is maximized by the fact that “students” are asking questions. If you're able to learn from a lecture, keep reading!

This video provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to efficiently use Git in a production environment. You'll begin from the very beginning: installing and configuring Git on different platforms.

Then you'll go to basics like managing repositories, three-stage approach, committing, creating local branches and tracking the remote ones and so on.

What I especially like about this training is the fact that it also covers more sophisticated topics. You'll learn what DAG is and how this structure influences a whole Git. You'll become a best friend of tags (both light- and heavyweight) and know how to use rebasing, amend, stashing and others. I've to mention that it's quite easy to get lost during these topics discussion, but you can always rewind the video and repeat a complex part.

A few words about technical details. The whole training is recorded in high-resolution, so it was a pleasure to watch it. The sound was also very high-quality. The only things missing are subtitles. It'd be a great help for foreigners and the disabled.

The verdict is simple. I would recommend this video to a friend.
