A few days ago I finished Functional Programming Principles in Scala course by Martin Odersky and [Coursera](http://www.coursera.com). I just wanted to share my thoughts on it, since it took quite a bit of my time during last seven weeks.

## Goal
My goal was to get a taste of functional programming which I had a very little contact with before. Also, I wanted to polish my Scala skills, because I'm still learning it. Was the plan accomplished? Well, definitely! But it wasn't a piece of cake!

## Challenges
It's quite challenging to change your mindset and start thinking in a functional way. But when you get the point, it's unbelievably rewarding!

Also, the resulting code is very elegant and consistent. However, I got to the point where I think it needs more understanding (or maybe just experience) not to make it inefficient, mainly because of have usage of recursion. Scala helps the situation by introducing *tail recursion*, but again, it takes time for a beginner's mind to wrap around it. Paradoxically, that's probably the biggest gain from the course - to **change the way you think**.

## Assignments
The most important part of the course were weekly assignments. I spent a lot of time on them and I really enjoyed every minute! They were challenging, but not in "turning you off" way.

Each assignment was rated in 10 points scale - 8 points for code validity and 2 for style. The score was calculated using automated tests, which is actually fully understandable, considering participants number (~50k last time I checked it). However, it looks like the grading introduces a lot of misunderstanding. I've read many comments about how it's misleading and how a high (or low) rate doesn't proof anything. I agree, but I can't really imagine how it could work without grades. I, personally, was really excited when I got 10/10 after a few hours of exercising my mind. And while it doesn't proof anything, I was at least ensured that I was on a good path.

## Lectures
Lectures were integral part of the course. I was watching them before each assignment and they were helping a lot. They were mainly focused on theoretical aspect. I could learn how the code is evaluated and how data structures work internally. That's good because most of tutorials and articles on the Internet focuses on a practical part, so a source of knowledge about what's going on under the hood is much appreciated. That wouldn't be so  easy, however, without Martin Odersky. He is a great teacher and it's quite obvious he's excited about what he is doing.

## What's next?
Well, I think I'll get back to reading [Programming in Scala](http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala_2ed) (which I highly recommend, by the way) and learning [Play! Framework](http://www.playframework.org).

To sum up, I need to say again that I really enjoyed the course. I feel I gained a lot from it. I'd like to thank you to both Martin Odersky and Coursera team!
